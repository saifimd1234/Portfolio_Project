## In-Depth Project Page

### Overview  
This project demonstrates real-world data analysis on a music store database using SQL. It explores the business dynamics by answering key questions on customer behavior, sales trends, and genre popularity. The analysis is structured into three query levels:
- **Easy:** Basic data retrieval, ordering, and simple aggregation.
- **Moderate:** Data refinement through joins and filtering.
- **Advanced:** Complex aggregations, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and ranking functions for in-depth insights.

### Key Features & Workflow

- **Easy Level Queries:**
  - **Senior Employees:** Identify the most senior employee by job title.
  - **Country with Most Sales:** Analyze invoices to pinpoint the top-performing country.
  - **Top Invoice Amounts:** Retrieve the top three significant sales transactions.
  - **Top Spending City & Customer:** Determine which city and customer lead in total spending.

- **Moderate Level Queries:**
  - **Rock Music Listeners:** List customers who primarily listen to rock music.
  - **Top Rock Artists:** Identify the top 10 rock bands based on the number of tracks.
  - **Longer Than Average Songs:** Highlight songs that exceed the average duration.

- **Advanced Level Queries:**
  - **High-Earning Artist Spending:** Analyze customer spending on the artist generating the highest revenue.
  - **Popular Genre by Country:** Determine the best-selling genre in each country.
  - **Top Customer by Country:** Find the highest-spending customer within each country.

### Tools & Technologies  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Query Techniques:**  
  - Aggregate Functions: `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`
  - Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Window Functions: `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`
  - Subqueries, Filtering, and Sorting  
- **Scripting & Version Control:** SQL scripts managed via Git & GitHub
