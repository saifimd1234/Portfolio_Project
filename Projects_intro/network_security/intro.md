## In-Depth Project Page

### Overview  
This Phishing Website Detection project leverages machine learning to safeguard against phishing attacks. By extracting and analyzing key URL attributes‚Äîsuch as IP address usage, URL length, token presence, and SSL certificate validity‚Äîthe project builds a classifier capable of distinguishing between malicious and legitimate websites. The pipeline is designed with production-readiness in mind, featuring automated data handling, robust validation, and streamlined deployment processes.

### Key Features & Workflow

- **Data Ingestion:**  
  - Automated CSV reading as part of an ETL process.
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets.

- **Data Validation:**  
  - Schema checks and handling missing values.
  - Sanity checks to ensure data integrity.

- **Data Transformation:**  
  - Feature engineering using URL-based attributes.
  - Encoding, scaling, and preparing data for modeling.

- **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
  - Experimentation with multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
  - Hyperparameter tuning and performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
  
- **MLOps & Deployment:**  
  - Containerization with Docker.
  - Cloud storage integration (AWS S3) for model artifacts and logs.
  - CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions.

- **Logging & Exception Handling:**  
  - Centralized logging throughout the pipeline.
  - Custom exception handling to manage unexpected issues.

### Project Architecture  
The project is structured as a complete ML pipeline, which can be visualized as follows:

- **Logging & Monitoring:** Custom Python logger, exception modules

### Dataset  
- **Source:** CSV file with 31 URL-based features.
- **Key Columns:**  
  - Example features include `having_IP_Address`, `URL_Length`, `Shortining_Service`, `SSLfinal_State`, `Domain_registeration_length`, and `Google_Index`.
- **Target Variable:** `Result` (indicating phishing or legitimate).

### ML Pipeline Details  
1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - Configurations for reading and splitting the data.
2. **Data Validation:**  
   - Ensuring all expected columns and correct data types are present.
3. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Feature encoding and scaling to prepare the dataset for model training.
4. **Model Training:**  
   - Running various classification models and fine-tuning with techniques like GridSearchCV.
5. **Evaluation:**  
   - Using multiple metrics to select the best-performing model.
6. **Deployment:**  
   - Containerizing the solution and deploying it on the cloud for real-time inference.

### Setup & Usage  
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PhishingWebsiteDetection.git
   cd PhishingWebsiteDetection
   ```
2. **Create & activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the training pipeline:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This command executes data ingestion, validation, transformation, and model training sequentially.

5. **Deploy via Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t phishing-detection .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 phishing-detection
   ```

### Additional Enhancement Ideas  
- **Explainable AI:**  
  Integrate tools like SHAP or LIME to provide model interpretability, helping users understand which URL features contribute most to the prediction.

- **Real-Time Data Integration:**  
  Incorporate live data feeds or web scraping modules to continuously update the model with new URLs and adapt to emerging phishing tactics.

- **Ensemble Methods:**  
  Experiment with ensemble techniques (e.g., stacking or boosting) to improve classification performance and robustness.

- **Automated Retraining & Drift Detection:**  
  Implement monitoring to detect data drift and trigger automated retraining pipelines to keep the model up-to-date.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  Develop a web-based dashboard for visualizing prediction metrics, model performance over time, and real-time alerts on detected phishing attempts.

- **Enhanced Security Features:**  
  Add layers of security such as anomaly detection, and integrate with SIEM systems for a more comprehensive cybersecurity solution.
