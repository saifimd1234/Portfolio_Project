## **In-Depth Project Page**

### **Overview**  
This project aims to predict **students' math scores** using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes demographic features (such as gender and parental education) and academic attributes (like reading and writing scores). The model helps understand key factors influencing academic performance and provides a data-driven approach to improving student outcomes.

---

## **Key Features & Workflow**

- **Data Ingestion:** Reads raw student performance data from a CSV file and prepares it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifies patterns in student scores and visualizes correlations between features.
- **Feature Engineering:** Transforms categorical and numerical data to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Compares multiple regression models using hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Persistence & Deployment:** Saves the best model for future inference.

---

## **Dataset Details**  
- **Source:** Contains student performance data with key attributes like:
  - **Demographic Data:** `gender`, `race_ethnicity`, `parental_level_of_education`, `lunch`, `test_preparation_course`
  - **Academic Performance:** `reading_score`, `writing_score`
  - **Target Variable:** `math_score` (to be predicted)
- **Size:** The dataset is split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** subsets for evaluation.

---

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering**

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to explore relationships between `math_score` and other variables.
  - Heatmaps to analyze feature correlations.
  - Bar charts to compare performance across demographic groups.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - **Imputation:** Handles missing values using median (for numerical data) and mode (for categorical data).
  - **Encoding:** Converts categorical features into numerical values using one-hot encoding.
  - **Scaling:** Standardizes numerical features (`reading_score`, `writing_score`) for better model performance.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Derived new features, such as an **"Overall Academic Performance Score"**, combining reading and writing scores.

## **Model Training & Evaluation**
- **Regression Models Tested:**
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Decision Tree Regressor**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
  - **XGBoost, CatBoost, and AdaBoost**
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
